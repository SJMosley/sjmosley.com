            <p><span class="zap-word"><b>Zapier</b></span> started me down a longer and more involved path learning the value of automation and increasing efficiency
                and I loved every minute of it. 
                The blog post that helped me most is <a href="https://zapier.com/blog/text-expander-how-to/">Type Less</a>. 
                I spent 30 minutes at work one morning reading it, then probably saved 30 minutes that day alone.
                As a customer service rep I typed the same thing often, and personalized it for the scenario.
                Text expansion is now part of my daily workflow. 
                When recommending tools to a company (or person) it would be a text expansion program for their team and <span class="zap-word"><b>Zapier</b></span>.
                Join at the lowest pricepoint and you can save much more than an hour of time in the month, 
                I probably saved 3-5 hours a month and was much better at quick email responses to customers 
                (all using the free plan, since the CEO wouldn't let me upgrade).

                I love that the company talks about tools that aren't their own on the blog, and is
                confident and knows their product well enough to know their audience. Each time <span class="zap-word"><b>Zapier</b></span>
                sends me an email it doesn't feel like they are trying to extract money out of me, it feels like I am learning and growing.
            </p>
            <p>
                I love that the color palette is named Ramona (I think from Scott Pilgrim), Batmobile, and Wolverine. 
                Although my favorite of the colors is Deep Space.
            <p>
                At a previous company, I saw some of my international team members work remotely while others were not allowed to
                which showed me the balance of not giving some amenities to only part of your employees.  <span class="zap-word"><b>Zapier</b></span>
                has avoided that with only remote work, and documented and improved the process the whole time.
            </p>
            <p>
                Mainly I want to work for <span class="zap-word"><b>Zapier</b></span> because it seems that as the team creates processes that improve their skills and job, they
                don't forget to think along the way.
            </p>

            <h2><a name="paper"></a>Paper</a></h2>
            <p>
                So what did I do? I wanted to build a prototype for a <span class="zap-word"><b>Zapier</b></span> mobile app.
                Firstly, does <span class="zap-word"><b>Zapier</b></span> need a mobile app?  While the focus on 
                enterprise keeps the audience and product well focused, there is significant
                usage of phones for business cases. So I think yes, eventually.
            </p>
            <ol><b>Start with Goals</b>
                <li>Make it easy to create zaps!</li>
                <li>Set (or pull) users apps for recommendations</li>
                <li>Manage zaps</li>
                <li>Keep it as simple as possible (you may have to display 750+ app icons)</li>
            </ol>
            <p>
                Research time! For this project it consisted of me making sure I was familiarized with the brand and ensuring the
                app would feel "familiar" and consistent if switching to or from desktop usage. I opened a bunch of tabs and visited basically every page
                of the website. I read 4 of 13 ebooks (Getting Started With <span class="zap-word"><b>Zapier</b></span>, Zap Templates Collection, The Ultimate Guide to Remote Work, and How to do Anything in Apps) in the <a href="https://zapier.com/learn/">learning center</a>. I looked at competitor apps 
                (IFTTT, Automate.io, and others I personally wouldn't consider direct competitors). I am ready.
            </p>
            <p>
                Now low-fi sketch and wireframes (I probably could have skipped the e-books for this part). In a real world scenario I would go through multiple of these before higher fidelity
                mockups.
            </p>

            <p>
                The wireframes look pretty much shot for shot like the website. I split things up by page and tried to make sure that
                the navbar and pages made sense without feeling too cluttered.

            <ul>
                For <a href="https://sketchapp.com/">Sketch</a> I created a couple guidelines for myself to improve my workflow.
                <li>Stick to sketches, but feel free to make positive changes.</li>
                <li>Try to stick to intervals of 8px to help with layout</li>
                <li>Try to have layer heirarchy match visual heirarchy, so other designers could more quickly make sense of it.</li>
                <li>Keep layers well named so that importing to Principle is easier.</li>
            </ul>

                Working with so many application icons immediately brings tons of color and clutter to the design. With that in
                mind I tried to push the whitespace and maintain simplicity. The build zap screens simplicity helps encourage
                users to think it is really easy to make a zap (cause it is until you have to narrow down 750+ apps 🙃).
            </p>
            <p>
                After finishing up the designs I realized I didn't follow the guideline of naming everything well for principle import.
                So after installing <a style="text-decoration:none" href="https://github.com/rodi01/RenameIt">RenameIt</a> I fixed that quickly
                and got rid of all the pesky Rectangle 3's.
            </p>
            <h2><a name="proto">Prototype</a></h2>
            <p>
                This is the long section cause we are going to be looking at some gif's. I used <a href="http://principleformac.com/">Principle</a>
                to make these higher fidelity prototype mockups.
            </p>
            <p>
                First we have the explore page, which after signing in (didn't mockup login screen) will give recommendations and be more customized to
                each users experience. This page, as on the desktop site,
                exists to serve the user templates and starter zaps that can help them get started with new automations.

                Since the space is limited, I put Build and My Zaps together. Both sections still have a way to get to them from
                anywhere within the application (the add zap button at the top goes to Build, and the navbar zaps goes to My Zaps).
                You should also be able to swipe between these sections.

                Building a zap is such an important piece I figured it needed to be represented as the simplest part of the application.
                So I put it on it's own screen, as I said above, and had the simple actions trigger more complexity through further screens.
                Often people don't use a majority of features within applications, so on the mobile version of <span class="zap-word"><b>Zapier</b></span> it would be important that
                we highlight the most used triggers and actions while letting the list of "less common options" grow a little to maintain simpicity.
            </p>

                This is a simple one of a zap expanding to show it's description and giving you the ability to switch a zap on and off.
                There would be similar functionality for tasks on the task history page.

                Lastly, but not leastly (hmmm questionable word there) we have the connected apps page. I removed the reconnect option,
                since you could have the disconnect button switch between Connect/Disconnect and be context aware of the app it is representing.

            <h2>What did I learn?</h2>
            <p>
                I learned more about working with so many elements. Mainly, since <span class="zap-word"><b>Zapier</b></span> has to work with so many app icons,
                you have to use those to bring the color into the application and focus on whitespace and simplicity in your designs
                even more than normal.
            </p>
            <p>
                When I got ready to import into Principle I thought I had done a good job with layer naming. Turns out I hadn't, I ended up going back
                and renaming hundreds of layers. Reimported, then went back again because I had forgotten about the layers within symbols (although I did not need to
                reimport I still wanted to clean up the sketch file).
            </p>
            <h2><a name="tldr">TLDR</a></h2>
            <p>
                What I uniquely bring to <span class="zap-word"><b>Zapier</b></span> is the ability to ask questions from 
                different perspectives since my background is in programming, design, and management.
                These questions and my background fuel my drive and encourage me to find the root of the problem I am solving for regardless of its domain.
                Also I can constantly recommend books to people (like <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Einsteins-Dreams-Alan-Lightman/dp/140007780X">Einstein's Dreams</a>).
            </p>
            <p>
                I think <span class="zap-word"><b>Zapier</b></span> is great, I would love to be a part of the team because the product is awesome and has a great goal that I personally resonate with.
                 <span class="zap-word"><b>Zapier</b></span> caring about culture even more due to not being together often is amazing.
                I know we could make awesome things together.

            <p>
                I am a product manager, designer, leader, lifelong learner,
                and rock climber.
            </p>
            <p>
                As a product manager with a background in product, design, 
                computer science, and leadership, I want to contribute to 
                products that improve the daily lives of others.
            </p>
            <p>
                By focusing on communication and documentation, I work to make sure companies
                and employees stay aligned. My diverse background lets me bridge the gap between
                technical and non-technical roles, doing what is necessary to create an amazing product with a customer focus.

            <ul><b>Additional Things</b>
                <li>I love rock climbing, it ignited a powerful drive in me I hadn't seen before.</li>
                <li>Somehow I used to hate reading, now I freaking love it. <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/18975415">Check it out</a> and lets talk about it.</li>
                <li>One of the first things I did when I started at my last company was install Giphy on Slack.</li>
                <li>I do not use <span class="zap-word"><b>Zapier</b></span> for my personal life because it costs $18.33
                    a month and I don't have enough things to make that worth it right now. So I settled for
                    IFTTT 😱 for those small tasks.</li>

            <p>Holy Cow 🐄 you made it to the end! Thanks for reading!</p>
