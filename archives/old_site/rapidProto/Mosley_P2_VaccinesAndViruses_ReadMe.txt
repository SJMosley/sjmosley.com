ReadME:
This game turned out well in my opinion I learned alot from it.
Although I would do some things differently now I am glad its finished.
I have alot of good code in here that is saveable. and many ideas
from that code that I can do later.


PostMortem:

The game is called vaccines and viruses because you were 
supposed to have to find and save people with 
vaccines (middle mouse click).

But I didnt end up putting that in there, since 
mechanically you were still shooting them, so
i decided it could be cut
