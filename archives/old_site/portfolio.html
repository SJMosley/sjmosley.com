                <h3>Composing Compounds</h3>
                <p>
                    A game experience built to bring the periodic table out of a realm of abstract knowledge to relatable items in the world. The target age is a middle school audience.</p> <p>After building a compound it will tell you the compound that you built. While subtly introducing concepts like lewis dot structures as a mechanic, and groups of elements through color scheme. On this project I was the <span style="color: #ff9933">Creative Director, Designer, and Programmer</span>.

                <p>
                    A platforming game for children that focuses on teaching avoidance of conflict. On this project I served as a <span style="color: #ff9933">Programmer</span> and helped write the first iteration of the character controller, and wrote the AI code for 3 different enemies. Tools used: Unity, SVN, Trello.

                <p>
                    Raaargh is a 3D monster control game built in UDK and deployed on iOS. The game was built as a demo for class not for actual market deployment. For the project I was a <span style="color: #ff9933">Programmer</span> and built the back end systems along with being responsible for iOS deployment. Tools used: UDK, iOS, Visual Studio, SVN.

                <h3>Rapid Prototyping</h3>
                <p>
                    All games below were each made in <span style="color: #ff9933">1 week</span>, so many did not get finished, many have bugs. All were made using gamemaker. Most of these games are really bad, very little drag and drop coding was used for these. </p> <p>While these are not games I am proud of in comparison to my newer work, I was and I learned a lot from each of these games. There is some original art along with borrowed art (most prevalent is Tim from braid).

                <h3>Game Design</h3>
                <p>
                    Each 2 page <span style="color: #ff9933">game design document</span> was made made in a week, while the 10-20 page documents were made in 2 weeks. I am proud of a few of the game ideas, but currently they only stand as such, and the ideas have yet to be implemented on. The prompt is shown here although the game document has the ability to stand alone. The game documents are formatted and recommend team sizes for making semester long game demoes.
